    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>
        Ramen Ichiraku was founded by Teuchi thirty-four years before the start of Part II. 
        Although it is quite small and has an unassuming appearance, Ramen Ichiraku has always 
        been popular with Konoha's villagers because of Teuchi's strong commitment to taste, giving 
        the ramen an almost artistic quality.[1] Like any ramen establishment, Ramen Ichiraku offers 
        various toppings, such as char siu and boiled eggs. In Konoha Hiden, seaweed had been the most 
        popular topping for several years until, after the Fourth Shinobi World War, it was surpassed by naruto.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 container Ocean's Halo No Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>1 tbsp miso paste</li>
        <li>0.5 cup reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup scallions, diced </li>
        <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>1 daikon radish </li>
        <li>4 cups cooked ramen noodles (4 packets of Maruchan; you won't be using the seasoning packet, so the flavor does not matter)</li>
        <li>Narutomaki</li>
        <li>Quorn meatless roast</li>
        <li>Nori (seaweed) snack-size sheets</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot or slow cooker, combine broth, soy sauce, miso paste, 
            bean sprouts, and 0.5 cup of scallions. Let simmer for 40 minutes 
            or slow cook for at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Let Quorn roast in oven at 425F for an hour. Cut into eight slices when done.</li>
        <li>Peel daikon radish into strips with a potato peeler and air fry at 375 for 
            20 minutes or until it begins to brown/crisp. You can also do this in a pan with just some olive oil spray.</li>
        <li>Cook ramen noodles and set in the bowl. Then add broth. Top with two slices of the Quorn, two nori rectangles, 
            one narutomaki slice, 1/4 of the green onions, and 1/4 daikon per bowl.</li>
        <li>Hard boil two eggs and split each in half. Put half an egg in each bowl before serving.</li>
